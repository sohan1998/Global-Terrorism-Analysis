# Global-Terrorism-Analysis

In this project we aim to perform regression analyses using Machine Learning algorithms to predict the impact that a terrorist attack will have on society.

Libraries used: Pandas, Numpy, MatPlotLib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Keras (Tensorflow backend).

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd

Target variable: Impact (Number of casualties + Number of people wounded)

Steps performed in the process:

1. Getting the dataset
2. Understanding the data
3. Data preprocessing
4. Model fitting
5. Model Evaluation
6. Comparing accuracy of various models.
