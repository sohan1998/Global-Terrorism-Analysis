# Global-Terrorism-Analysis-Project

In this project we aim to perform regression analyses using Machine Learning algorithms to predict the impact that a terrorist attack will have on society. 

Libraries used: Pandas, Numpy, MatPlotLib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Keras (Tensorflow backend).

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd

Target variable: Impact (Number of casualties + Number of people wounded)

Steps performed in the process:
1. Getting the dataset
2. Understanding the data
3. Data preprocessing
4. Model fitting
5. Model Evaluation
6. Comparing accuracy of various models.


Models used:
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
XG Boost
Artificial Neural Network
Support Vector Regressor

Acccuracy metrics used:
Mean Absolute Error
r2 score
Root Mean Squared Error
